## Overview

This project implements an agentic Graph RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for healthcare data analysis. It combines:

- **Intelligent Query Routing**: Automatically classifies queries and routes to appropriate handlers
- **Pre-built Tools**: Fast, optimized queries for common patient data operations
- **Dynamic Cypher Generation**: LLM-powered query construction for complex analytics
- **Graph Database**: Neo4j with Synthea synthetic patient data (5,885 patients, 1.2M+ encounters)
- **Configurable LLMs**: Support for Anthropic Claude and SambaNova models

The system intelligently determines whether to use pre-built queries or generate custom Cypher based on query complexity, optimizing for both performance and flexibility.

- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/health

## Usage

### Query Types

The chatbot supports two types of queries:

#### 1. Standard Queries (Pre-built Tools)
For common patient-specific questions, the agent uses pre-built tools with flexible name matching:

**Patient Procedures**
- "What procedures has Ethan had?" (matches first name)
- "Show me all procedures for John Smith" (matches full name)
- "What procedures did Smith have?" (matches last name)

**Patient Conditions**
- "What conditions does Sarah have?"
- "List all diagnoses for John Smith"
- "What's wrong with Thompson?" (last name match)

**Patient Medications**
- "What medications is David taking?"
- "Show me drugs prescribed to Maria Johnson"
- "What is Brown taking?" (last name match)

**Patient Search**
- "Find patients named John"
- "Search for patients with last name Smith"
- "Show me patients named Maria Garcia"

**Patient Encounters**
- "What encounters has Ethan had?"
- "Show me hospital visits for John Smith"
- "List encounters for Williams" (last name match)

**Patient Similarity**
- "Find patients similar to John Smith"
- "Who are the most similar patients to Sarah?"
- "Show me patients with similar medical profiles to Williams"

**Name Matching Features:**
- **First name only**: "Ethan" → matches any patient with first or last name containing "Ethan"
- **Last name only**: "Smith" → matches any patient with first or last name containing "Smith"
- **Full name**: "John Smith" → matches patients where full name contains "John Smith"

#### 2. Complex Queries (Cypher Subagent)
For analytics, aggregations, and complex questions, the agent uses a specialized Cypher subagent that constructs custom queries:

**Provider Analytics**
- "Which providers treated the most patients?"
- "Show me providers specializing in cardiology"
- "What's the average patient load per provider?"

**Procedure Analytics**
- "What's the most common procedure performed?"
- "How many procedures were done in 2023?"
- "Which procedures cost the most?"

**Organization Queries**
- "Which organizations have the highest patient volume?"
- "Show me all healthcare organizations in Boston"

**Time-Based Analysis**
- "How many emergency visits were there in 2023?"
- "Show me patient visits by month for last year"
- "What's the trend in wellness visits over time?"

**Multi-Entity Queries**
- "Show me patients who had both diabetes and hypertension"
- "Which providers work at multiple organizations?"
- "Find patients with more than 5 emergency visits"

**Aggregations**
- "What's the average age of patients with heart conditions?"
- "Count encounters by type"
- "Show me the distribution of conditions across patients"

### How It Works

#### Query Flow (Optimized Architecture)
1. **User Query**: You type a natural language question
2. **Validation**: Validation node checks if query is relevant to Synthea medical database
   - **Relevant queries** → Proceed to agent
   - **Irrelevant queries** → Return rejection message and end
3. **Agent Analysis**: Main LLM agent analyzes the query and selects appropriate tools
4. **Tool Execution**: Agent calls one or more tools based on the query:
   - **Pre-built tools** for common patient queries (procedures, conditions, medications, encounters, search)
   - **execute_custom_query tool** for complex analytics (triggers Cypher subgraph)
   - **get_database_schema tool** for schema information
5. **Result Synthesis**: Agent receives tool results and synthesizes them into natural language
   - Uses conditional synthesis instruction injection for clarity
   - Agent self-synthesizes without separate summary node
6. **Response**: Final answer returned to user with executed queries shown
7. **Context Maintenance**: Conversation history preserved for follow-ups

#### Cypher Subgraph Flow (within execute_custom_query tool)
When the agent selects the execute_custom_query tool for complex analytics:
1. **Subgraph Entry**: Tool invokes internal Cypher subgraph with user question
2. **Cypher Agent**: Specialized LLM with deep Synthea schema knowledge (400+ lines)
   - Analyzes the question and generates appropriate Cypher query
   - Includes LIMIT clauses, optimizations, and safety checks
3. **Query Execution**: execute_cypher_query tool runs the generated query
4. **Loop/Refinement**: Results return to Cypher Agent for potential refinement (conditional loop)
5. **Subgraph Exit**: Final results return to main agent for synthesis
6. **Query Transparency**: Generated Cypher query tracked and shown to user

**Key Benefits of This Architecture:**
- **Streamlined flow**: Validation → Agent → Tools → Agent (synthesis) → End
- **Fewer LLM calls**: 2-3 total (validation + agent tool selection + agent synthesis)
- **No separate router**: Agent directly selects tools using built-in tool-calling
- **No separate summary node**: Agent synthesizes its own tool results
- **Validation first**: Rejects irrelevant queries before processing
- **Cypher subgraph**: Deep query expertise isolated within execute_custom_query tool
- **Query tracking**: All queries tracked via Command pattern with reducers
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns with subgraph architecture

- Procedure: Medical procedures
- Condition: Medical conditions/diagnoses
- Drug: Medications
- Provider: Healthcare providers
- Organization: Healthcare organizations

**Key Relationships:**
- (Patient)-[:HAS_ENCOUNTER]->(Encounter)
- (Encounter)-[:HAS_PROCEDURE]->(Procedure)
- (Encounter)-[:HAS_CONDITION]->(Condition)
- (Encounter)-[:HAS_DRUG]->(Drug)

## Agent Tools & Architecture

The main LangGraph agent uses a streamlined architecture with validation, tool selection, and self-synthesis:

### Architecture Overview
```
START → Validation → Agent → Tools → Agent (synthesis) → END
                      ↓ (if not relevant)
                      END
```

### Main Graph Nodes
1. **Validation Node**: Entry point that validates query relevance to Synthea database
   - Uses lightweight validation LLM with structured output
   - Routes relevant queries to agent, rejects irrelevant queries
2. **Agent Node**: Main LLM with tool-calling capabilities
   - First invocation: Analyzes query and selects appropriate tools
   - Second invocation: Synthesizes tool results into natural language
   - No separate router or summary nodes needed

### Available Tools
The agent has access to 8 tools (all shown as individual nodes in the graph visualization):

#### Pre-built Patient Query Tools
1. **get_patient_procedures**: Retrieve patient procedures (limit: 30)
2. **get_patient_conditions**: Retrieve patient conditions (limit: 30)
3. **get_patient_medications**: Retrieve patient medications (limit: 30)
4. **get_patient_encounters**: Retrieve patient encounters (limit: 30)
5. **search_patients**: Search for patients by name (limit: 30)
6. **get_database_schema**: Get database schema information
7. **find_similar_patients**: Find patients with similar medical profiles using KNN embeddings (limit: 5)

#### Custom Analytics Tool (with Cypher Subgraph)
8. **execute_custom_query**: Handles complex analytics using internal Cypher subgraph
   - Contains its own specialized Cypher Agent (LLM with deep schema knowledge)
   - Internal execute_cypher_query tool for query execution
   - Unconditional edge from Cypher Agent → execute_cypher_query
   - Loop-back edge for query refinement
   - Handles: aggregations, analytics, multi-entity queries, time-based analysis

### Conditional Edges
- **From Validation**: Routes to Agent (relevant) or END (not relevant)
- **From Agent to Tools**: Conditional edges to each of the 8 tools based on query analysis
- **From Agent to END**: Direct edge when no tools needed
- **From Tools to Agent**: Return edges (dashed) for result synthesis

## Cypher Subagent Technical Guide

### Overview

The Cypher Subagent is a specialized AI agent (implemented as a LangGraph subgraph) that constructs custom Cypher queries for complex analytics questions. It operates **within** the execute_custom_query tool as an internal subgraph.

### Key Features

#### 1. Deep Schema Knowledge
The Cypher subagent has a comprehensive 400+ line system prompt that includes:
- Complete node type definitions with all properties
- All relationship types and directions
- Multi-label node handling
- Common query patterns
- Cypher syntax guidelines
- Database statistics

#### 2. Safe Query Generation
- **Always includes LIMIT** clauses (default 50)
- **Validates** patient identification patterns
- **Optimizes** for performance
- **Explains** what the query does
- **Formats** results as readable tables

#### 3. Intelligent Tool Selection
The main agent knows when to select execute_custom_query (which triggers the Cypher subgraph):
- Analytics and aggregations
- Provider/organization queries
- Time-based analysis
- Multi-entity relationships
- Complex filtering/grouping
- Statistical queries and counts

### When the Subagraph is Used

#### Agent Selects execute_custom_query (triggers Cypher Subgraph)
- "Which providers treated the most patients?"
- "What's the most common procedure?"
- "How many emergency visits in 2023?"
- "Show patients with both diabetes and hypertension"
- "Average age of patients with heart conditions"
- "Count encounters by type"

#### Agent Selects Standard Tools
- "What procedures has Ethan766 had?" → get_patient_procedures
- "List medications for John" → get_patient_medications
- "Find patients named Smith" → search_patients
- "What encounters did Sarah have?" → get_patient_encounters

### Schema Knowledge in Subagent

The subagent knows about:

**Node Types (26 labels)**
- Patient (5,885 records)
- Encounter (1,274,720 records)
- Procedure, Condition, Drug
- Provider, Organization
- And 19 more...

**Relationships (18 types)**
- HAS_ENCOUNTER (1,274,720)
- HAS_DRUG (569,538)
- HAS_DIAGNOSIS (517,612)
- And 15 more...

**Properties for Each Node**
Example - Patient node:
- id, firstName, lastName
- birthDate, age
- expenses, income
- city, county, location
- And more...

**Multi-Label Handling**
Encounters have type labels:
- Base: Encounter
- Types: Ambulatory, Emergency, Inpatient, Wellness, etc.

Query pattern: `MATCH (e:Emergency)` or `WHERE labels(e) CONTAINS 'Emergency'`

### Query Generation Process

#### Step 1: Analyze Question
```
User: "Which providers treated the most patients?"
```

#### Step 2: Generate Cypher
```cypher
MATCH (p:Patient)-[:HAS_ENCOUNTER]->(e:Encounter)-[:HAS_PROVIDER]->(prov:Provider)
RETURN
    prov.name AS provider_name,
    prov.speciality AS specialty,
    count(DISTINCT p) AS patient_count
ORDER BY patient_count DESC
LIMIT 20
```

#### Step 3: Explain Query
```
This query finds all providers, counts distinct patients they've treated,
and orders by patient count to show the busiest providers.
```

#### Step 4: Execute & Format
```
Query Results (20 records):

provider_name | specialty | patient_count
------------------------------------------
Dr. Smith     | Cardiology | 145
Dr. Johnson   | General    | 132
...

Cypher Query Used:
[query shown above]
```

### Implementation Details

#### File Structure
```
backend/
├── agent.py                 # Main agent with validation, tools, and execute_custom_query
├── cypher_subagent.py       # Cypher query generator subgraph (invoked by execute_custom_query)
└── neo4j_utils.py          # Database utilities and execute_custom_cypher method
```

#### Key Components

**1. execute_custom_query Tool** ([agent.py](backend/agent.py))
```python
@tool
def execute_custom_query(user_question: str, tool_call_id: ...) -> Command:
    """
    Execute a custom database query for questions that don't fit standard tools.
    This tool uses a specialized Cypher subgraph to construct and execute queries.

    Invokes the Cypher subgraph, extracts results, and returns as Command.
    """
```

**2. Cypher Subgraph** ([cypher_subagent.py](backend/cypher_subagent.py))
```python
def get_cypher_subgraph():
    """
    Returns the compiled Cypher subgraph (singleton).

    Subgraph structure:
    - cypher_generator node: LLM that generates Cypher queries
    - execute_query node: ToolNode that executes queries
    - Conditional routing based on tool calls
    - Loop back for query refinement
    """
```

**3. Cypher Agent Node** ([cypher_subagent.py](backend/cypher_subagent.py))
```python
def call_cypher_generator(state: CypherSubgraphState) -> dict:
    """
    LLM-based node with 400+ line schema prompt.
    Generates Cypher queries using execute_cypher_query tool.
    Returns messages with generated query for tracking.
    """
```

**4. execute_cypher_query Tool** ([cypher_subagent.py](backend/cypher_subagent.py))
```python
@tool
def execute_cypher_query(cypher_query: str) -> str:
    """
    Executes generated Cypher query against Neo4j.
    Returns formatted table results.
    Called by Cypher Agent within subgraph.
    """
```

### Benefits of This Architecture

#### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Main Agent**: Selects tools, maintains conversation, synthesizes responses
- **Validation Node**: Filters irrelevant queries before processing
- **Cypher Subagent**: Isolated expert in query construction within execute_custom_query tool
- **Tools**: Each has single responsibility (procedures, conditions, medications, etc.)

#### 2. Cost Optimization
- Validation: Fast relevance check prevents processing irrelevant queries
- Standard queries: Fast, minimal LLM usage (pre-built queries)
- Complex queries: Cypher subagent LLM only used when execute_custom_query tool is selected
- Fewer LLM calls: No separate router or summary nodes (2-3 calls total)

#### 3. Maintainability
- Schema changes: Update Cypher subagent prompt only
- New query types: Add examples to subagent system prompt
- Main agent: Stays focused on tool selection and synthesis
- Tool addition: Just add @tool decorated function to tools list

#### 4. Safety
- Validation prevents irrelevant query processing
- Queries validated before execution in subgraph
- LIMIT clauses enforced in Cypher generation
- Error handling at multiple levels
- Command pattern with reducers for state management

#### 5. Transparency
- All queries tracked via executed_queries state
- Generated Cypher queries shown to user
- Query source tracked (which tool/function)
- Graph visualization available at /graph endpoint

```bash
# Ensure environment is configured (backend/.env)
# Then run tests
python test_cypher_subagent.py
```

Tests verify:
1. Query generation works
2. Cypher execution works
3. End-to-end flow works

#### Example Test Output
```
Testing Cypher Subagent - Query Generation
------------------------------------------------------------
Question: Which providers treated the most patients?
✓ Query generated successfully

Cypher Query:
MATCH (p:Patient)-[:HAS_ENCOUNTER]->(e:Encounter)-[:HAS_PROVIDER]->(prov:Provider)
RETURN prov.name AS provider_name, count(DISTINCT p) AS patient_count
ORDER BY patient_count DESC
LIMIT 20

Explanation:
Finds all providers and counts distinct patients they've treated.
```

### Extending the Subagent

#### Adding New Query Patterns

Edit [cypher_subagent.py](backend/cypher_subagent.py) and update `SYNTHEA_SCHEMA_DETAILED`:

```python
SYNTHEA_SCHEMA_DETAILED = """
...existing schema...

## NEW QUERY PATTERNS

### Finding Care Plans
11. Get care plans for patient:
    MATCH (p:Patient)-[:HAS_ENCOUNTER]->(e:Encounter)<-[:CARE_PLAN_START]-(cp:CarePlan)
    WHERE p.firstName = 'Name'
    RETURN cp.code, e.date
"""
```

#### Adding Safety Rules

Update the system prompt in `generate_cypher_query()`:

```python
## ADDITIONAL SAFETY RULES

8. **Never delete data** - Only use MATCH and RETURN
9. **Validate dates** - Use datetime() function
10. **Check for null** - Use WHERE field IS NOT NULL
```

### Performance Characteristics

- **Validation**: <1 second (lightweight validation LLM)
- **Tool Selection**: 2-4 seconds (main agent LLM call)
- **Standard Tool Execution**: <1 second (pre-built queries)
- **Cypher Query Generation**: 2-5 seconds (Cypher subagent LLM call within execute_custom_query)
- **Query Execution**: <1 second (Neo4j)
- **Result Synthesis**: 2-4 seconds (main agent LLM call)
- **Total Time (Standard)**: 3-6 seconds (validation + agent + tool + synthesis)
- **Total Time (Complex)**: 5-10 seconds (validation + agent + Cypher subgraph + synthesis)

### Security Considerations

1. **No User Input in Cypher**: User questions passed to LLM, not directly to Cypher
2. **Read-Only Queries**: Subagent instructed to only generate MATCH/RETURN
3. **LIMIT Enforcement**: Prevents large result sets
4. **Error Handling**: Database errors don't expose internals
5. **Query Validation**: Subagent validates before execution

### Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
1. **Query Caching**: Cache common query patterns
2. **Query Optimization**: Learn from slow queries
3. **Multi-Step Queries**: Break complex questions into multiple queries
4. **Query Validation**: Pre-validate with Cypher parser
5. **Feedback Loop**: Learn from successful/failed queries
6. **Query Templates**: Store and reuse common patterns

### Summary

The Cypher Subagent (implemented as a subgraph within execute_custom_query tool) provides powerful analytics capabilities while maintaining:
- **Safety**: Validated, read-only queries with enforced LIMIT clauses
- **Efficiency**: Only invoked when agent selects execute_custom_query tool
- **Transparency**: Generated queries tracked and shown to user
- **Isolation**: Separate subgraph with own state and routing logic
- **Maintainability**: Deep schema knowledge isolated from main agent
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new query patterns to subagent prompt

This streamlined architecture (validation → agent → tools → synthesis) combines:
- **Fast pre-built tools** for common patient queries
- **Flexible Cypher subgraph** (within execute_custom_query) for complex analytics
- **Validation** to filter irrelevant queries
- **Self-synthesis** by the agent without separate summary node
- **Query tracking** via Command pattern with reducers
- **Visual representation** available at /graph endpoint

## Patient Similarity Embeddings

### Overview

The patient similarity feature uses Neo4j Graph Data Science (GDS) library to generate high-dimensional embeddings that capture patient similarity based on multiple medical and demographic factors. This enables finding patients with similar medical journeys, which is useful for:

- **Cohort identification**: Find similar patients for clinical studies
- **Treatment planning**: Identify patients with comparable medical profiles
- **Pattern discovery**: Understand common patient trajectories
- **Personalized insights**: Compare a patient's journey to similar cases

### How It Works

The similarity system uses **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** embeddings that combine:

1. **Encounter Similarity (256D)**: Based on types and frequency of medical visits
2. **Procedure Similarity (256D)**: Based on types and frequency of procedures
3. **Drug Similarity (256D)**: Based on types and frequency of medications
4. **Demographic Features**: Age, total encounters, expenses, income, etc.

These are combined into a **775-dimensional feature space** that is then reduced to **256-dimensional KNN embeddings** using FastRP (Fast Random Projection).

### Setup Instructions

The patient similarity embeddings require the **Neo4j Graph Data Science (GDS) plugin** to be installed. See [backend/README_EMBEDDINGS.md](backend/README_EMBEDDINGS.md) for detailed setup instructions.

**Quick Setup:**
```bash
# Install GDS plugin in Neo4j (via Neo4j Desktop or manual installation)
# Then generate embeddings:
cd backend
source ../.venv/bin/activate
python patient_similarity_embeddings.py
```

This will:
1. Create aggregated patient relationships
2. Generate similarity embeddings for encounters, procedures, and medications
3. Create combined KNN similarity embeddings
4. Establish similarity relationships between patients

**Processing Time**: 10-30 minutes depending on database size (for 5,885 patients)

### Using the Tool

Once embeddings are generated, the agent can find similar patients:

**Example Queries:**
- "Find patients similar to John Smith"
- "Who are the most similar patients to Sarah?"
- "Show me patients with similar medical profiles to Williams"

**Tool Response Includes:**
- Similarity score (0.0 to 1.0)
- Patient demographics (age)
- Healthcare utilization metrics (total encounters, procedures, medications)
- Total expenses

### Technical Details

**Similarity Relationship**: `KNN_SIMILARITY`
- Created between patients with similar medical profiles
- Contains `similarityScore` property (higher = more similar)
- Top 25 nearest neighbors stored for each patient

**Embedding Properties**:
- `encounterSimilarityEmbed`: 256D vector
- `procedureSimilarityEmbed`: 256D vector
- `drugSimilarityEmbed`: 256D vector
- `knnSimilarityEmbed`: 256D vector (recommended for queries)

**Query Example** (executed by the tool):
```cypher
MATCH (p:Patient)-[sim:KNN_SIMILARITY]-(similar:Patient)
WHERE p.firstName + ' ' + p.lastName CONTAINS $patient_name
RETURN similar
ORDER BY sim.similarityScore DESC
LIMIT 5
```

### Configuration

The embeddings can be customized in [backend/patient_similarity_embeddings.py](backend/patient_similarity_embeddings.py):

```python
embeddings_gen.generate_all_embeddings(
    embedding_dim=256,           # Dimension of embeddings
    node_similarity_top_k=10,    # Top K for node similarity
    knn_top_k=25,                # Top K for KNN (neighbors per patient)
    similarity_cutoff=0.01       # Minimum similarity threshold
)
```

### Performance Considerations

- **First-time setup**: 10-30 minutes to generate embeddings
- **Query performance**: Sub-second (queries use pre-computed embeddings)
- **Memory usage**: Depends on database size and embedding dimensions
- **Embeddings persistence**: Stored in Neo4j, no regeneration needed unless data changes

For more details, see [backend/README_EMBEDDINGS.md](backend/README_EMBEDDINGS.md).
